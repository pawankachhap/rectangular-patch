Put the values of Dielectric-Constant of the substrate material,central Frequency, and substrate thickness
inside the parantheses as shown: 

#dielectric constant
er=(2.33)

#Resonant frquency
F=(3.5)*1000000000

#substrate thickness
h=(0.787)/100

Note: Frequency value in GHz, and thickness value (h) in Centi-meters (cm)
